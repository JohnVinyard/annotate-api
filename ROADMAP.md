# What Should I Have by Oct 1st?

1. a simple, but decent user experience that allows human users to create accounts and to create annotations
    - Better authentication story for the API and the user interface
    - Vue app that closely mirrors the API's structure
    - probably a more HATEOAS API
1. a UI that includes some form of similarity search, ideally with an intuitive exploratory interface, perhaps one that uses:
    - custom google maps tiles
    - mongodb geospatial queries
1. A significant amount of data, including:
    - Phat Drum Loops
    - NSynth
    - MusicNet
    - OLPC
    - Other Internet Archive sources used by https://cochlea.xyz
