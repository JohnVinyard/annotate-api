    - Better authentication story for the API and the user interface

    - probably a more HATEOAS API
1. a UI that includes some form of similarity search, ideally with an intuitive exploratory interface, perhaps one that uses:
    - custom google maps tiles
    - mongodb geospatial queries

    - Phat Drum Loops
    - NSynth
