NSynth is an audio dataset containing 305,979 musical notes, each with a 
unique pitch, timbre, and envelope. For 1,006 instruments from commercial 
sample libraries, we generated four second, monophonic 16kHz audio snippets, 
referred to as notes, by ranging over every pitch of a standard MIDI piano 
(21-108) as well as five different velocities (25, 50, 75, 100, 127). The 
note was held for the first three seconds and allowed to decay for the final 
second.
