You've found it! The beat collector's mecca, the funky fountain of youth, the internet's largest and oldest free library of classic drum breaks: PhatDrumLoops.com!

This site is 100% non-profit and banner-free. What's the catch? None. This site exists for everyone, it is a learning tool, it is more important than just making a buck. So pull up a chair and a good pair of speakers and let the beats flow.

Where to start? If this is your first time here, you're probably anxious to get to the drums! Feel free to browse the [FULL LIST](http://www.phatdrumloops.com/beats.php) of breaks in our library or search the library using the form at the top of this page.

As will probably be obvious to most of you, I haven't updated the site in a long-ass time. Despite my best intentions, I simply don't have the time anymore. But I know this site brings joy to lots of people around the world each day, so I'm planning to leave it up for as long as I can afford to.
