MusicNet is a collection of 330 freely-licensed classical music recordings, 
together with over 1 million annotated labels indicating the precise time of 
each note in every recording, the instrument that plays each note, and the 
note's position in the metrical structure of the composition. The labels are 
acquired from musical scores aligned to recordings by dynamic time warping. 
The labels are verified by trained musicians; we estimate a labeling error 
rate of 4%. We offer the MusicNet labels to the machine learning and music 
communities as a resource for training models and a common benchmark for 
comparing results
